  OUR JOURNEY
  SENTRAL College was established in 2002 with the aspiration to be a tertiary education platform for youth. Its founding goal was to develop students into wholesome capable individuals who will support their family, serve the community and strive for the country. Dr Chiang Geok Lian as the Founding Principal and CEO of SENTRAL was appointed to uphold the establishment's purposeful goal. To this date, she has been a strong pillar of support and the catalyst of SENTRAL's growth.

  PARTNERSHIP TOWARDS SUCCESS

  With Dr Chiang at the helm, we embarked on an enduring journey to provide the highest quality academic development. We continuously seek partnerships with prestiguos institutions of higher learning, both localy and from abroad, to bring various offerings for students with different career preferences.

  We have amassed a rich portfolio of programmes as our partner institutions grew since SENTRAL started. The partners include UNITAR, Swinburne University, University of Salford, Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), and The International Air Transport Association (IATA). The programmes we offer span from certificates to bachelors and masters degrees, encompassing the areas of Foundation Studies, Accounting, Business, Management, Information Technology, Tourism and Early Childhood Education.

  FOCUSED VISION, DRIVING GROWTH

  The name SENTRAL COLLEGE PENANG was adopted in 2013, but the college was founded as SENTRAL Technology College. The shift was significant as it reflect our success in growing the organisation into an all-encompassing institution.

  The growth and expansion have brought an increased student's population rendering our original location at Jalan Zainal Abidin inadequate. Subsequently, we expanded our operations and relocated to a bigger and a better-equipped 14-storey building at the junction of Lebuh Penang and Lebuh Bishop in George Town. We proudly call it the SENTRAL Tower.

  New SENTRAL is thriving in the hustle and bustle at the heritage enclave of George Town to produce engaging graduates to serve the community. We reaffirm the founding goal of SENTRAL and are committed to realising our vision.

  PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE
  Every year we gather our thoughts to remember and savour the past, to celebrate the achievement of our students in their great journey of learning and to look forward to welcoming new students who join us for a journey that will bring them the richness of learning and to prepare them to live a life of significance. SENTRAL is pleased to play a vital role in the provision of higher educational programmes to meet the varying needs of current day learners wishing to obtain globally recognised qualifications in pursuit of their career goals.

  After almost 15 years since its inception in the Jalan Zainal Abidin Campus, SENTRAL College moved to its new George Town Campus in December 2013. The move is rooted deeply in the College's commitment towards providing a time and place for young students to develop wholesomely to serve their family, community and the country. I would like to thank all the constituent members of the College, past and present, students and staff alike, for contributing to the success of the College that has powered the College to this great heights.

  SENTRAL continues to put the learning and education needs of the students first by focusing on quality and integrity to provide the student with a body of knowledge in their chosen disciplines while providing exciting stimulus for a lifelong learning experience. There is an emerging shift from education for employment (developing the ability to do a specific job) to education for employability (developing the ability to adapt skills to new working environments). This fits well into the government's aspiration of becoming a high-income nation, which is hinged on having people who have a high sense of personal mastery and can extend their abilities to change organisational realities. All planned programmes of learning at SENTRAL are relevant, comprehensive and presented to meet the real needs of learners for the real world.

  As you step into your educational journey at SENTRAL and beyond, think and act more to become useful; choose knowledge and skills over physical comfort and idleness, choose leadership over being mere average, choose to be innovative, pro-active and knowledge building than be complacent, passive and parroting. You will develop habits that will stand you in good stead when you set out in your life and your chosen profession. Be confident and be as interesting as you can and, work in partnership with colleagues and friends to make progress in the world. We look forward to welcoming you to be part of SENTRAL's community of learners.
